# BashUtilityScripts
A set of bash scripts if find useful. I take ideas over the internet and then adapt them to my needs.

## Utilities

### Automatic selected text translation

When you select some text with the mouse pointer, you can keybind the script to show a notification with the
translated text.

### Autimatic laptop hibernation with simple battery monitor 

Add a simple cron task to keep an eye on the battery of your laptop and hibernate when some threshold is reached.
Useful when no power management is available.
